# Rails-ey Services with Middleman and Cloudfront

[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) is a static site generator, but with all the nice features of Rails.

You can extract out your static sites and single-page applications into Middleman apps, and get all the upsides of:

* Security: Nothing to hack
* Speed: static files are fast!
* Stability: No servers to go down

Without affecting developer productivity.
